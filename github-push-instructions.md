# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "3js-military-game")
   - Choose visibility (public or private)
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, connect your local repository by running these commands:

```
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote called "origin"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Push the develop branch to GitHub
git checkout develop
git push -u origin develop

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

3. Verify the connection:
```
git remote -v
```

You should see your GitHub repository URL listed as both fetch and push destinations.

4. Your repository is now set up with GitHub. You can create new branches and push them as needed:
```
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes, then commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push the feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

5. When you're ready to merge changes into develop or main, you can create a pull request on GitHub.
